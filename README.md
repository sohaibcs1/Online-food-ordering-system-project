# 3rd: Delivery Boy

Navigate to the delivery destinations by showing the shortest path to minimize time and fuel cost. While traveling to each destination, the application would show running order time along with a running distance they have covered so far. Once the delivery boy arrives at the destination, he will collect money from the customer and update the database as a complete order. Once all deliveries are completed, the application navigate the delivery boy back to the store with the quickest route. And finally, the Manager will make new notification for next deliveries by SMS.<br>
